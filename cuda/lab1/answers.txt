Task 1:
    1.1 How many cores will simple.cu use, max, as written?

    1.2 Is the calculated square root identical to what the CPU calculates? 

    1.3 Should we asume that this is always the case? 

Task 2:
    2.1 How do you calculate the index in the array, using 2-dimensional blocks?

    2.2 What happens if you use too many threads per block?

    2.3 At what data size is the GPU faster than the CPU?

    2.4 What Block size seems a good choice compared to what?

    2.5 Write down your data size, block size and timing data for the best GPU performance you can get.

    2.6 How much performance did you lose by making data accesses non-coalesced?

Task 3:
    3.1 What was the problem?
        The problem was a bad choice of the grid and block dimensions.
        For every computation unit a different Block was used with dimensions 1x1.

    3.2 How did you correct it?
        Adapting the Grid dimensions. Using less blocks with more threads in each block.

    3.3 What speedup did you get?
